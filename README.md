# Trillionaire-Bug-Reports


With everyone moving away from 1.12 and me moving onto projects beyond Trillionaire, I'm going to be pulling support for the modpack soon. Before then, I want to fix up the really outstanding bugs so I don't leave a terrible mess.

If you've encountered a bug on the modpack, please report it under the Issues tab at the top. In a few weeks to a month, I'll go over everything and try to add a fix to it, culminating in a final update for Trillionaire.

As for my future work, I'm on-and-off working on modded minecraft content. Life is pretty busy for me now and most of my free time is spent on whatever helps me relax or keeps me from going crazy during this pandemic. If I release something cool in the future, I hope you all check that out ;)

Thanks again for staying fans of the stuff I've made throughout my creative "career", and know that I appreciate each and every one of you!
